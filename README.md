Title:
Capstone Project
Data Classification and Summarization Using IBM Granite
Student Development Initiative 

Overview:
This project aims to evaluate whether a chatbot's response is appropriate to the emotional context of the user input. The main focus is the match between the user's emotion and the type of chatbot response (positive, negative, or neutral).
When creating this project, I utilized the IBM Granite Model to assist in processing data, this capstone project was typed using google collab.

lINK Dataset:

Insights & Findings:
Data Summary
Positive Response: 182
Negative Responses: 94
Neutral Response: 10
Total Data: 286

AI Support:
When using a dataset from kaggle with more than 286 columns, I used the IBM Granite Model when doing classification to save time, after that AI also helped when I summarized the classified data, and created a bar plot with the help of AI which can also be useful for making conclusions and recommendations at the end.
